This is a Python codec that does nothing but read the input into a string and write that string unchanged to output.  It is not useful as is but is intended to be a base for writing other codecs for Domain Specific Languages (DSL).

It was hacked from an example entitled "Use PEP 263 for metaprogramming (Python recipe)" at http://code.activestate.com/recipes/546539-use-pep-263-for-metaprogramming/
